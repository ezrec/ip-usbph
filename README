What does libip-usbph do?
-------------------------

The library has APIs for the following:

 * Setting all symbols on the LCD
 * A built-in ASCII to 14-segment LCD font converter
 * Backlight control
 * Keypad events 

The library does not control the microphone nor the
speaker of the phone - use the standard Linux ALSA USB
audio for those services.
